<hr>

<blockquote>
‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE<br>
This bypass only allows access to websites in their desktop form running in an embedded WebView browser on the home screen.
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Download Apple's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334">Shortcuts app</a></li>
<li>Find <code>Shortcuts</code> in the settings app and enable <code>Private Sharing</code>.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/856bd46469b4419f8b385b495dcadf9c">Shortsploit shortcut</a>.</li>
<br>
<blockquote>
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING<br>
It is highly recommended to use this hack once your screen time is fully depleted, as its usage still counts as screen time on the home screen.
</blockquote>
<li>Open the <a href="shortcuts://open-shortcut?name=Shortsploit">Shortsploit shortcut in Shortcuts' editor</a>.</li>
<li>Click the <code>‚ìò ("i" with a circle around it)</code> on the shortcut settings and click <code>Add to Home screen</code> and follow the instructions to place it on the Home screen.</li>
<li>Now whenever you feel like browsing when your screen time is over, just click the Shortsploit icon on the home screen, enter your desired website or search query, and start surfing the web!</li>
<br>
<blockquote>
üí° TIP<br>
It is possble diguise Shortsploit as a seperate app if you download the app icon you wish to disguise it as from the web and set it as its icon and name.
